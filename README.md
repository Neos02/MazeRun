# Maze Run

This project was started for a Game Development class at my University.

You can play the game [here](https://neos02.github.io)!

## How to Play

You are at the start of a maze with the goal of finding the finish. You must work your way through the maze while avoiding enemies in order to stay alive. Once you reach the end, you will receive the time it took for you to complete the maze as your score. Have fun!
